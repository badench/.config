## Base 16 colors
I use base 16 colors. In order to set this up follow the instructions at [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell). Along with the base16-shell I use [base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim).

I use [COC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for language completion for the following languages
- Rust I use [coc-rls](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-rls/) for completion. Along with [rust-lang/rust.vim](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim) for styling and syntax highlighting.
